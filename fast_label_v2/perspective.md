# This tool could be generalized, with a tkinter interface.

With the TKinter interface, we could edit:
- label id/label value start in mask (then for each object of this class we do +1, until two classes overlap)
- nth object of this label is displayed
- select the number of possible classes at the beginning of the tool
- select if multiple objects of the same class can exist or not
- edit the 4 colors of the colormap ?

It is intended that, when they are multiple objects of the same class + multiple classes per img, the label_id is 
linked to the label_text by annotations.csv
